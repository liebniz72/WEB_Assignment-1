                <strong>Biryani</strong> is a flavorful mixed rice dish that
                originated in the Indian subcontinent. <br />
                It is typically made with a combination of long-grain Basmati
                rice and spiced meat, <br />
                along with a variety of aromatic spices. While there are many
                variations of biryani, <br />
                one popular option is beef biryani, which is made with tender
                chunks of beef <br />
                that are marinated in a blend of spices and then cooked with the
                rice.

                is a traditional yogurt-based dessert from the Indian
                subcontinent, and in Bengali cuisine, it is a beloved sweet
                treat that is enjoyed by people of all ages. This creamy and
                tangy dessert is made by fermenting milk with a culture of live
                bacteria, which converts the lactose in the milk into lactic
                acid, giving it a tangy flavor and thick consistency.
